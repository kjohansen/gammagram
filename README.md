A local html application intended to facilitate card handling and deck management for a certain 2010 tabletop roleplaying game. This is a personal project. Targets include:
- furnishing dummy card data for demonstration
- implementing random card draw from a set deck
- implementing id-based card acquisition
- implementing a workable 'hand' interface for card management
- implementing an accessible deck-building interface
- ensuring local persistence of hand and deck configurations
- ensuring a clear visual presentation consistent with the source material
